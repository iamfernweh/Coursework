// 1. Use the JavaScript console or the script block within an HTML page to create three variables.
// 2. The combination of the lock is 10 - 40 - 39. 
// 3. You must use three different arithmetic operators that will generate each individual number.
// 4. Then display the combination on the HTML page, or in an alert popup.

let num1 = 5 + 5; //10 addition
let num2 = 4 * 10; //40 multiplication
let num3 = 50 - 11; //39 subtraction

// Display message in an alert popup
let alertMsg = `You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination: ${num1} - ${num2} - ${num3}`;
